Thank you for considering to contribute to LazyFS, our main goal is to achieve a useful and correct tool to test storage systems consistency. LazyFS is a new Filesystem and we are constantly looking for bugs that could break its correctness.

Feel free to submit Issues or Pull Requests and I will review them as soon as I can!
